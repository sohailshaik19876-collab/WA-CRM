// ============================================================
// Provider-agnostic catalog types — the shape every CatalogProvider
// (BudunProvider, DataSourceCatalogProvider) must normalize into before
// anything reaches the resolver, the generic catalog tools, or the LLM.
//
// This is the single choke point described in
// docs/integrations/budun-erp/WACRM_ERP_CATALOG_INTEGRATION_SPEC_v4.md
// §6/§7 and docs/integrations/ai-data-integration/01_MASTER_EXECUTION.md
// "WHITELIST ERP": a provider's `search`/`getProduct`/... methods return
// ONLY these fields. There is no field here for IMEI/serial/cost/
// margin/supplier — a provider adapter cannot leak them because there is
// nowhere on `CatalogProduct` to put them, independent of whatever the
// upstream ERP/sheet actually returned.
